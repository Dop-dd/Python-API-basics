Introduction

Now that we've introduced APIs and learned a bit about HTTP and REST, 
e will work on building an application (the recipe-sharing app known as Smilecook). 
In this chapter, we aim to kick-start the actual project development. 
This is a recipe-sharing platform in which users can create accounts 
and share their own recipes with other users. As you can imagine, 
it will contain a lot of API endpoints for our users so that they can
 manage their recipes. We will be using the Flask-RESTful package to
  efficiently develop our RESTful API.

This chapter will talk about the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) 
of these recipes, as well as how to set the publish status of the recipe.

Recipe Model:
    name:   The name of the recipe.
    description:  The description of the recipe.
    num_of_servings:  The number of servings.
    cook_time:  The cooking time required. This is an integer whose units are in seconds.
    directions:   The directions.
    is_publish:   The publish status of the recipe; the default is draft.
